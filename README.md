=============

PiggyBank is a mobile app to share expenses on the go.

You can create new accounts "piggies" with just one tap, these piggies can be used to save money compulsively 
wherever you are.

They can be just for you or can be shared with a bump, NFC or selecting contacts from your mobile, for example:
 - With your SO for a future trip
 - With your friends in a party to get more drinks & ice
 - A charity piggy for an emergency.

The only data transfered between mobiles is the target account number, so piggies can still be re-shared,
allowing viral money saving without worring about your accounts security.

Oink, Oink.
